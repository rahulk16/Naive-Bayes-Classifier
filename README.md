## Implementing the Naive-Bayes-Classifier algorithm in C++

This is an implementation of the [Naive Bayes Classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) algorithm in C++.  

Running
------
To test the algorithm, **compile and run NBClassifier.cpp**

Dataset Information
------


The code was written specifically for this dataset and will require significant changes before running on some other dataset. 

Built With
